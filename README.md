If you would like to follow on the tutorial for the app you can visit the article on medium: How to build and deploy React app with Spring Boot and MySQL server.

## The purpose of the webapp

The purpose of the app was to learn as to : 

 1. How to build Spring Boot apps?
 2. How to build React apps?
 3. How to encapsulate the backend to the frontend?
 4. How to deploy React and Spring Boot along with MySQL DB in my server?

### Installation

You'll need maven, npm and JAVA pre-installed, which most probably you'll already have.  To run the application, run the following commands from the console.

```sh
$ mvn clean
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/springboot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```


####  PostScript

I hope this app gives some insight on how to compile the backend and the frontend into a single executable file making deployment a breeze. 

Happy coding 😃
